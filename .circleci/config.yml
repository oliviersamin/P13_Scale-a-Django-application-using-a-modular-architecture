# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/
orbs:
  # The python orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can use repeatedly in your configuration files
  # Orb commands and jobs help you with common scripting around a language/tool
  # so you dont have to copy and paste it everywhere.
  # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/python
